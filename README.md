# flashcards
I'm trying to make an easy way to copy + paste the structure of
a flashcard, front and back, that slides between the two on hover,
and clicks through to more info

Currently stuck figuring out how to incorporate the front of card
text that will slide to show the back of card text same time as the
background image
